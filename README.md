# Chat with Your Database

This project is a SQL-powered Chat Assistant built with Flask, LangChain, llama3-8b from Groq, and a state-driven execution flow. The assistant accepts natural language questions from users, formulates SQL queries to retrieve data from a database, executes those queries, and generates a meaningful final response.

### How the Assistant Works
The assistant works by processing user questions in the following steps:

#### 1. Receive User Question:
The user provides a question via the /ask API endpoint.

#### 2. Query Generation:
A structured query prompt is built by invoking a pre-defined template from the LangChain Hub. The LLM (llama3-8b-8192 from Groq) generates a syntactically valid SQL query based on this prompt.

#### 3. Query Execution:
The assistant uses QuerySQLDatabaseTool to run the generated query against the SQL database.

#### 4. Answer Generation:
Based on the query result, the assistant generates a concise answer using the LLM.

#### 5. Response:
The assistant returns the full response and final answer to the user.

### Setup and Running Locally
#### Prerequisites
  Python 3.8 or higher
  A valid Groq API key
  Database URI (for connecting to your SQL database)

#### Installation
##### 1. Clone the repository:
        git clone https://github.com/AnanyaGodse/chat-with-your-database.git
        cd chat-with-your-database
        
##### 2. Install the dependencies:
        pip install -r requirements.txt

##### 3. Set environment variables:
        DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///path-to-your-db.db"
        GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
#####  4. Run the Flask server:
        python app.py


### Known Limitations:
#### 1. Database Schema Dependency:
The assistant's ability to generate valid SQL queries depends heavily on the schema of the connected database. If the schema is incomplete or ambiguous, results may be inaccurate.

#### 2. Limited Query Generation Complexity:
The current system uses single-shot prompting for query generation. For more complex queries, introducing few-shot prompts or advanced query-checking steps can enhance the system's capabilities.

#### 3. Lack of Query Validation:
Currently, there is no robust mechanism to validate or debug generated queries. Adding query validation and better error handling would improve the assistant's reliability.

#### 4. Question Understanding Limitations:
The assistant struggles with vague or ambiguous queries and performs best when questions are very specific. Improved prompt engineering or the use of more sophisticated agents could help address this issue.

#### 5. No Memory or Context Persistence:
The assistant does not maintain any memory of past interactions or user questions. Each query is treated independently, without context from previous exchanges.


### Suggestions for Improvement:
#### 1. Enhance Error Handling & Query Validation:
Provide detailed error responses when query execution fails, including SQL error traceback and suggestions for query correction. Add steps to validate and sanitize generated SQL queries before execution, reducing errors and ensuring query safety.

#### 2. Few-Shot Prompting:
Improve query generation by incorporating few-shot examples, helping the assistant handle complex queries more accurately.

#### 3. Optimizations for Large Databases:
Implement techniques like query pagination, indexing strategies, or batch processing for better performance with large datasets.

#### 4. Agent-Based Execution:
Introduce agent-driven execution to:
* Query the database iteratively to refine answers.
* Handle query errors gracefully and regenerate corrected queries.
* Provide schema-based insights to users.

#### 5. Integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
Enhance the system by using RAG techniques to combine database retrieval with LLM context generation. This approach can merge structured data from the database with additional unstructured knowledge sources for richer answers.

#### 6. Context Persistence and Memory Management:
Address the lack of context by:
* Session-Based Memory: Keep track of interactions during a session to provide context-aware responses.
* Persistent Storage: Store user interactions and query histories in a database for long-term memory capabilities, allowing follow-up questions based on prior answers.
* LLM Memory Integration: Explore memory-based language model features that retain relevant conversation context.
